            <h4 id="another">Another Round</h4>
            <p><em>Another Round — the original title Druk, Danish for a bender, is better — reunites Vinterberg,
                    Lindholm and Mikkelsen after 2012’s The Hunt.
                    In that one, Mikkelsen played a kindergarten teacher wrongly accused of being a paedophile.
                    Here he moves up the Danish educational system to play secondary-school history teacher
                    Martin,
                    whose work life and home life have lost their spark.
                    Meeting with similarly lacklustre colleagues — sports teacher Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen),
                    music head
                    Peter (Lars Ranthe) and ringleader Nikolaj (Magnus Millang) — at a raucous birthday dinner,
                    the
                    oldies hatch a plan inspired by Norwegian psychologist Finn Skårderud’s controversial thesis
                    that
                    most people go through life with too little alcohol in their bloodstream.
                    Citing some famous functioning alcoholics (Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway), the four
                    make a
                    pact to stay low-level drunk all day, monitoring and recording the results with scientific
                    empiricism. </em></p>

                    filmmaker
                    Thomas
                    Vinterberg entered into the spirit of child's play with fellow director Lars von
                    Trier
                    ("Breaking
                    the Waves" 1996), taking a "Vow of Chastity" as part of their "Dogma 95" and finding
                    liberation in
                    the self-imposed limits. Though the tireless self-promoter won both praise and scorn
                    for his
                    half-serious, half tongue-in-cheek embrace of Dogma 95, with some parties sneering
                    he wasn't
                    exactly
                    "reinventing the wheel" by walking in the footprints of Cassavetes, De Sica and
                    Altman, he
                    certainly
                    backed all the talk with a brilliant film adhering to the manifesto's edicts,
                    "Festen/The
                    Celebration" (1998), an expertly paced melodrama employing child abuse as a catalyst
                    to
                    explore
                    unbridled machismo, patriarchal arrogance and the prevalence of Danish racism. His
                    feature
                    debut,
                    "De Storste helte/The Greatest Heroes" (1996), had been a fairly typical example of
                    the
                    "road movie"
                    genre and paled in comparison.</em></p>

            <p><em>Born and raised in the small town of Fountain, Colorado, Jon Watts
                    turned to
                    making short
                    videos
                    before he graduated from high school. His creative output led to a
                    scholarship to attend New
                    York
                    University. After graduating, Watts joined Park Pictures, a
                    production
                    company making music
                    videos,
                    internet content, and short films. One of these was a trailer for
                    "Clown"
                    (2014), a horror
                    film they
                    claimed was directed by Eli Roth. Roth's popularity generated
                    interest in
                    the trailer,
                    eventually
                    from Roth himself, who contacted Watts and his friends and helped
                    get the
                    funding to make
                    the film.
                    Released four years after the initial trailer was made, the film was
                    also
                    written by Watts
                    and his
                    friend Christopher Ford. Watts and Ford again collaborated on the
                    script for
                    "Cop Car"
                    (2015), with
                    Watts directing Kevin Bacon as a bad cop who crosses paths with a
                    couple of
                    unfortunate
                    kids. The
                    film was roundly applauded by filmgoers and critics and brought him
                    to the
                    attention of
                    executives
                    at Marvel, who were looking for someone to bring a vision to the
                    next
                    iteration of
                    "Spider-Man."
                    Watts, again collaborating with Ford on the script, got the call and
                    directed "Spiderman:
                    Homecoming" (2017). The film was largely praised by critics and fans
                    alike,
                    who cheered the
                    successful reimagining of a classic super hero. In 2017 it was
                    announced
                    that Watts would
                    direct a
                    sequel to the film.

            <p><em>Born in Shanghai in 1958, Wong Kar-Wai first studied
                    graphic
                    design
                    then
                    enrolled in a TV
                    drama-training program, which provided his
                    introduction to
                    filmmaking. Wong
                    began his career
                    as a
                    screenwriter, first earning a co-writing credit for
                    the
                    romantic
                    drama "Once
                    Upon a Rainbow"
                    (1982)
                    and continuing to create in a number of different
                    genres
                    including
                    dramas
                    and crime
                    comedies. His
                    first film as a director was "As Tears Go By" (1987)
                    an
                    atmospheric
                    gangster
                    movie that had
                    success
                    at the Hong Kong box office. Wong's next directorial
                    effort,
                    "Days
                    of Being
                    Wild" (1990) was
                    less
                    successful. A more personal film, set in the 1960's,
                    it
                    focused more
                    on mood
                    and atmosphere
                    and
                    lacked a clear plot. Wong's third film "Chungking
                    Express"
                    (1994)
                    would be
                    his international
                    breakthrough. Conceived and shot during a break from
                    editing
                    his
                    epic
                    martial arts wuxia
                    "Ashes of
                    Time" (1994), "Chungking Express" was a quirky
                    romantic
                    thriller
                    that gained
                    the notice of
                    Quentin
                    Tarantino who championed its US release. After
                    finishing his
                    vision
                    of
                    "Chungking Express"
                    with the
                    film "Fallen Angels" (1995), Wong was named Best
                    Director at
                    the
                    Cannes Film
                    Festival for
                    his
                    wrenching romantic drama "Happy Together" (1997).
                    Next, Wong
                    completed an
                    informal trilogy,
                    which
                    began with "Days of Being Wild." The next two films
                    "In the
                    Mood for
                    Love"
                    (2000) and "2046"
                    (2004),
                    are again atmospheric reflections on romantic
                    relationships
                    in 1960s
                    Hong
                    Kong. After making
                    a short
                    film to contribute to the anthology "Eros" (2004),
                    Wong made

                    and his
                    first film shot in America. "My Blueberry Nights"
                    (2007) the
                    film
                    starred
                    Norah Jones with
                    Jude Law

            <p><em>Chloe Zhao's life was primarilyguided by a
                    quest for
                    information.
                    Born in
                    China, she grew up
                    in a
                    place where she felt trapped, like
                    she was
                    never
                    going to
                    get out.
                    When her
                    family finally
                    moved
                    away to London when she was in high
                    school,
                    she then
                    researched and
                    learned
                    what she had
                    missed
                    being in China. She was able to
                    separate
                    what was
                    true about
                    her
                    home
                    country and what was
                    false,
                    which led her to studying Political
                    Science
                    at Mount
                    Holyoke
                    College
                    in
                    Massachusetts.
                    However, her
                    time studying politics made her
                    disenfranchised by
                    the
                    subject. Her
                    fascination with
                    politics was
                    about learning people's stories, so
                    she
                    decided to
                    transition into
                    film.
                    Attending NYU's
                    graduate
